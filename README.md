- 👋 Hi, I’m @Karthiggeyan
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, machine learning and customer experience and how they all work together.
- 🌱 I hold a Associate Certification in Data Analytics from Talentlabs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on these areas and apply this knowledge to help businesses make decisions that are based on fact, not hyperbole.
- 📫 Feel free to get in touch on karthickmava@gmail.com, thanks!
